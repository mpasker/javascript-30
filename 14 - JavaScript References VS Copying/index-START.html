    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // use slice method on original array or the reference.

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Jimbo";

    const person = {
      name: 'Matt Pasker',

    };

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    // again a reference is made instead
    
    // const captain = person;
    // person.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
